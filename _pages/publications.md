For a complete list of my most recent scholarship since arriving at Calvin, see 
[Calvin's Faculty Activity Report](https://datawise.quickbase.com/db/bfvin7iyc/tablereport?a=q&qid=125&nv=1&v0=Schuurman%2C+Derek).
My work falls into two distinct categories: *technical* and *perspectival* publications \(with most of my recent work
falling into the second category\). For a summary of technical publications, see my 
[technical research](https://sites.calvin.edu/derek/research.html) page.
