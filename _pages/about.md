Derek Schuurman\'s [personal story](bio.html) includes working in
[industry](industry.html) for several years before returning to academia.
His interest in technology began in his early teens with [ham radio](ham.html) and 
his first computer, a [Timex-Sinclair ZX-81](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX81).
He is also interested in the bigger picture (metaphorically, not in the
number-of-pixels sense) of ethics, faith, and technology.
He is author of the book 
[*Shaping a Digital World*](https://www.ivpress.com/shaping-a-digital-world){target="_blank"}
and co-author of 
[*A Christian Field Guide to Technology for Engineers and Designers*](https://www.ivpress.com/a-christian-field-guide-to-technology-for-engineers-and-designers){target="_blank"},
both published by IVP Academic.

Prof. Schuurman is a fellow of the [American Scientific Affiliation](https://asa3.org)
and was made a senior member of the [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/). He is
member of the [ACM](https://www.acm.org/), [CES](https://www.christianengineering.org/),
[ACMS](https://www.acmsonline.org/), a book review editor for
[*Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith*](https://network.asa3.org/general/custom.asp?page=PSCF), 
a regular contributor to the 
[*Christian Scholars Review* blog](https://christianscholars.com/author/derek-c-schuurman/),
and a [columnist for *Christian Courier*](https://www.christiancourier.ca/author/derek-schuurman1/).

Research interests include [robotics and computer vision](research.html), embedded systems and IoT, 
CS pedagogy, philosophy of technology, and faith and technology issues.
