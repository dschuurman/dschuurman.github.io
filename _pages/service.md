Over the years my students (and former students) and I have been
involved with computing service projects for schools in both Central
America and Africa. We have worked mostly with schools and universities
and have witnessed firsthand that \"talent is universal; opportunity is
not.\"

There are many challenges that arise when participating in service
projects. I gradually came to realize we needed to change our approach
if we were best to help computing in these contexts. Best practices
avoid \"blueprint approaches\" and focus on people not products. It is
also important not to view technology as the ultimate solution to
problems.

Short term service projects come with many potential pitfalls, so
working with experienced partners and thoughtful organizations is
essential. We have learned that it is most helpful to \"train other
trainers\" and work with local partners who set the agenda. A good
resource for service projects is [*When Helping
Hurts*](https://www.chalmers.org/when-helping-hurts).

Besides technical assistance, we have also worked on sharing curriculum
and pedagogy for teaching computing. In addition to this, we have also
explored [how faith informs teaching computing in Christian
education](https://digitalcollections.dordt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2877&context=pro_rege)
and how [computer technology connects to the biblical
story](https://digitalcollections.dordt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2949&context=pro_rege).

### The Raspberry Pi

Most of our recent work has made use of the [Raspberry
Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org) to provide computers for schools in
majority world countries. The Raspberry Pi is is a device about the size
of a deck of cards and capable of running a full desktop operating
system while consuming only a few watts of power. It includes USB ports
for connecting a keyboard and mouse along with a variety of other
peripherals, an ethernet adapter, and an HDMI monitor connection. While
the Raspberry Pi was originally constructed for hobbyists, it has shown
to be an appropriate technology for use in schools majority world
countries. Rather than shipping bulky, old, refurbished computers with
all the associated problems, the Raspberry Pi is a very small device
that can be easily shipped overseas. It is also manufactured to comply
with RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) directives. It requires
no fans or moving parts; instead of a hard drive it relies on a single
microSD card for its storage. It runs the Raspberry Pi OS which includes
a wide variety of free and open source educational programs that can be
installed. What is more, it can be purchased new with a case and power
supply for a modest price.

#### The ARCHIE Pi

More recently we have configured Raspberry Pi\'s to run as an 
[ARCHIE Pi](archie-pi.html). The ARCHIE Pi is essentially an \"internet in a
box\" by providing an open wi-fi access point with a variety of
educational content for use in remote locations where no internet access
is available. It includes [Christian Education
Resources](https://github.com/dschuurman/en-kuyers-cer) provided by the
[Kuyers
Institute](https://calvin.edu/centers-institutes/kuyers-institute/) and
a variety of additional educational content is available to be
installed. The ARCHIE Pi requires only a Raspberry Pi and a large
microSD card to store all the content. It runs \"headless,\" ie. without
a screen or keyboard. For a more detailed description of the ARCHIE Pi project,
see this talks presented at the 2023 ASA conference:
